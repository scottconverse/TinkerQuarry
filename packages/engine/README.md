# KimCad Engine for TinkerQuarry

**Internal engine package for TinkerQuarry's local describe-to-print workflow.**

KimCad remains the engine/CLI/protocol name inside the TinkerQuarry product. The user-facing app,
installer, status, and release proof live at the repository root and under `apps/ui`.

</div>

### Why it's different

- **Local-first & private** — runs entirely on your computer; no account, no cloud, no API key required. Prompts, photos, and sketches never leave the machine unless you opt into a cloud model. The core path is CPU-only — no discrete GPU.
- **Deterministic geometry** — common shapes come from a parametric template engine ([86 families](docs/templates.md)), _not_ a neural net, so the output is solid, watertight, and dimensionally meaningful. Drag a slider and the part re-renders locally in under a second.
- **Real printability** — every part is validated against your printer and material _before_ it can be sliced; the bundled PrintProof3D engine adds overhang / bridge / bed-adhesion analysis and a 0–100 readiness score.
- **Slice & print** — download a print-ready file or send it straight to your printer (Bambu LAN, OctoPrint, Moonraker, PrusaLink), always behind an explicit confirmation.
- **Editable CAD out** — with the optional [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/) engine, template-built parts also export an editable `.STEP` you can keep modeling in Fusion / FreeCAD / SolidWorks.

### What the TinkerQuarry installer puts on your machine

The product installer (`TinkerQuarry_<version>_x64-setup.exe`) packages this engine behind the
TinkerQuarry Studio app:

- The TinkerQuarry WebView2 shell and bundled front end.
- The KimCad Python engine and local HTTP API.
- Checksum-pinned OpenSCAD, OrcaSlicer, and PrintProof3D subprocess tools.
- Per-user writable data for settings, models, temporary tool mirrors, and saved designs.

### Beta notes — honest status

- **It's a beta.** The product happy path and a broader browser smoke are real and verified, but real-hardware print validation, comprehensive accessibility/error-path/export browser coverage, and richer visual-diff/explain surfaces remain beta work. See `../../docs/STATUS.md`.
- **A curated catalog of ~29 printers** across the top makers (Bambu, Creality, Prusa, Anycubic, Elegoo, Qidi, Sovol) — each build-volume-gated and **slice-proven in CI**; three of them (Bambu P2S, A1, Elegoo Neptune 4 Max) are **reference printers** also wired for native direct-send. The rest of the 1,400-profile library is on disk and promoted into the picker as each machine clears the slice bar ([supported printers](docs/supported-printers.md)).

> **For beta testers — the fastest path:** use the TinkerQuarry installer produced by the root release
> workflow, open TinkerQuarry, describe a part, slice it, then send through mock or configured
> hardware connector.

<details>
<summary><b>Stage-by-stage history</b> (0 → 11, each tagged)</summary>

- **Stages 0–7** (`stage-0` … `stage-7`) — the deterministic core: design-plan IR, the template
  engine + live sliders, OpenSCAD render, mesh validation + the Printability Gate, auto-orient,
  Manifold3D hardening, the model layer (advisor + bake-off), and Smart Mesh readiness + the
  arm's-length PrintProof3D engine.
- **Stage 8** (`stage-8`) — the **CadQuery parallel backend**: mutual OpenSCAD↔CadQuery fallback in
  an arm's-length worker, plus editable **STEP/BREP** export.
- **Stage 8.5** (`stage-8.5`) — **usability**: local-first persistence + the "My Designs" library,
  refine-as-a-conversation with version history, numeric entry, mm/inch units, the in-app Settings
  screen, and the first "describe with a photo" on-ramp.
- **Stage 9** (`stage-9`) — **image & sketch on-ramps** on a dedicated, working local vision model
  (`qwen2.5vl:3b`); a dimensioned sketch reads its written dimensions as written.
- **Stage 10** (`stage-10`) — **direct print**: send a sliced part straight from the app (picker →
  in-app confirm → live status), a Bambu-native LAN connector for the P2S/A1, and in-app model
  downloads with progress.
- **Stage 11** (`stage-11` + `beta`) — the **Windows installer** (WebView2 shell, bundled Python +
  SPA + OpenSCAD + OrcaSlicer + PrintProof3D) and the TinkerQuarry beta gate.

Current release proof and remaining beta work live in the root [STATUS matrix](../../docs/STATUS.md).

## What it does

```
prompt → design plan (JSON) → OpenSCAD → render → mesh validation
       → Printability Gate → auto-orient → harden (Manifold3D)
       → Smart Mesh readiness → [confirm] slice → validated print job + report
```

The engine is deterministic where it counts. Parametric CSG produces closed,
manifold geometry by construction, so output is dimensionally meaningful — not
lumpy neural meshes. The deterministic catalog is **86 parametric families** — from
boxes, enclosures, hooks and clips through a decor world of frames, dishes, planters,
ornaments, stands and hangers, to engineering hardware (washers, plates, brackets,
standoffs, Gridfinity, fasteners). Every family carries an **honesty tier** —
_benchmarked_ (what-you-set-is-what-you-get) or _baseline_ (real, gate-verified geometry
with a real-world fit/load/pattern caveat to check first) — and each is render-verified
against its analytic bounding box with a trusted CadQuery `.STEP` twin. The full catalog is
[`docs/templates.md`](docs/templates.md). For template-backed parts the browser UI shows **live
parameter sliders**: drag one and the part re-renders locally in well under a
second with no model call (the `templates.py` engine; proof in
`docs/benchmarks/stage-5-template-families.md`). You can also type exact values and
switch between mm and inches — see [`docs/guide-sliders-and-units.md`](docs/guide-sliders-and-units.md).

Every built part gets a **Smart Mesh readiness** report card — a 0–100 score, a plain
verdict, the risks, and concrete recommendations — synthesized from the Printability Gate
plus the arm's-length **PrintProof3D** validation engine (bundled + on by default in the
installed beta; optional from source), and
— once you've designed a few parts — an honest "compared to your past parts" line from a
local-first history. The card also shows a **confidence** — **High** when the PrintProof3D engine
ran and returned a usable report, **Medium** on the gate alone, and **Low** when the engine ran but
couldn't fully analyse the mesh. It's advisory: the
deterministic gate stays the slice authority, and the card never claims the engine ran when it
didn't. _(Stage 7 — done; tagged `stage-7`.)_

### Saving your work _(Stage 8.5 — done; tagged `stage-8.5`)_

Your designs are now kept automatically. The moment a part is built it's saved to a local **My
Designs** library and the page gets its own address, so a refresh (or coming back tomorrow) restores
the part and its sliders instead of losing it. The library lives entirely on your machine under
`~/.kimcad/designs/` — nothing leaves the computer. From My Designs you can reopen, rename,
duplicate, delete, and **export** a design as a portable `.kimcad` file (a backup you can re-import
on another machine — not a printable STL). A short walkthrough is in
[`docs/guide-my-designs.md`](docs/guide-my-designs.md).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.13** — the supported line for this version (it's what the lockfile, the CI
  gate, and the optional CadQuery backend are all built and proven on)
- OpenSCAD 2026.03.16 on Windows (`lib3mf` lets it emit 3MF as the _render_ output, else STL; either
  way the slice path consumes an STL, so a `lib3mf`-less build does not block printing)
- OrcaSlicer (CLI)
- An LLM backend. KimCad is **local-first**: out of the box it talks to a local
  runtime, so no API key and no network are required. **You don't install it by hand** —
  on first run KimCad sets up its own AI engine: it reuses a system
  [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) if one is present, otherwise it downloads Ollama's official
  **portable** build (~1.4 GB, no separate install / no admin) into KimCad's own data folder
  and runs it headless. (LM Studio also works if you prefer to run your own.) A cloud API is
  an optional, off-by-default fallback — enable it in the in-app **Settings** screen (via
  [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), where you pick the cloud model), or in
  `config/local.yaml` (DeepSeek / OpenRouter / any OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

OpenSCAD and OrcaSlicer are fetched as pinned portable builds into `tools/` by the
setup step (see below); a system install can be pointed to via `config/local.yaml`.

The TinkerQuarry Studio UI lives in `../../apps/ui`. Node/pnpm are needed to rebuild that app and
to produce the native Tauri package.

## Setup

> **Not a developer?** Use the TinkerQuarry installer and root docs. The section below is the
> from-source engine developer path.

```
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:  .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:  source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For a reproducible Python 3.13 beta environment, install from the committed
lockfile first (`pip install -r requirements.lock`), then install KimCad editable
with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

Then fetch the CAD/slicer binaries into `tools/` (standard library only — no extra
dependency):

```
python scripts/fetch_tools.py
```

On Windows this fetches OpenSCAD **2026.03.16** (snapshot build, Manifold backend, checksum-pinned)
and OrcaSlicer as verified, checksum-pinned portable builds. The OrcaSlicer pin is **v2.4.0-alpha** on purpose: the 2.3.2
"stable" build is the only stable that carries the Bambu P2S profile, but it
crashes on every CLI slice on a GPU-less machine (upstream issue #12906), whereas
2.4.0-alpha handles that case and ships the same P2S profile. The macOS/Linux
builds are not yet verified (spec §7.5); install those manually and point
`config/local.yaml` at them.

Finally, the local AI. **KimCad sets this up for you** — on first run it reuses a system
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on `localhost:11434` if one is present, otherwise it downloads
Ollama's official **portable** build (~1.4 GB, a one-time engine download — no separate
install / no admin) into KimCad's own data folder and runs it headless; then it fetches the
two models (~**11.1 GB** total) with progress via the in-app setup wizard's **Set up KimCad's
AI** button (Stage 10). The default planner is **Mellum2** (`JetBrains/mellum2-instruct-q4_k_m`)
— the on-device model that won the v1.5-6 bake-off (10/10 completed, 6/10 graded, 39.9s mean vs
the prior default's 9/10, 3/10, 61.2s — every axis; ~8.1 GB, ~9-10 GB RAM) on the target machine
(a 32 GB box with a 780M iGPU — the v3.0 spec's reference box is the slightly stronger
Beelink 890M, so anything that runs here runs on the spec reference too). Smaller boxes
downshift (to the prior default, `qwen2.5:7b`, then smaller) — run `kimcad models` for a
hardware-matched pick. Full report: `docs/benchmarks/stage-v156-model-bakeoff.md`.

To pull the models by hand instead (you have Ollama, or just prefer the terminal):

```
ollama pull JetBrains/mellum2-instruct-q4_k_m
ollama pull qwen2.5vl:3b
```

The second pull is the **dedicated local vision model** for the photo/sketch on-ramps
(Stage 9): measured on the target box, `gemma4:e4b`'s vision is broken on this stack (the
model itself reports no image was provided), while `qwen2.5vl:3b` reads dimensioned
sketches 3/3 — see `docs/benchmarks/stage-9-vision-onramps.md`. Both run in the same
local Ollama; images never leave the machine. That is all the LLM setup required — no API
key, no network. To enable a cloud fallback the
easy way, use the in-app **Settings → Cloud acceleration** opt-in (OpenRouter; you pick the
model; the key is kept in the OS credential store — Windows Credential Manager — and shown
only masked; if no credential store is usable, KimCad falls back to its local settings file
and the Settings screen discloses that. See `docs/guide-settings-and-cloud.md`). To configure it in files instead — a
different local model, or a cloud backend (DeepSeek / OpenRouter / any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint) — set the active backend and its key in `config/local.yaml`; see `config/default.yaml`
for the shape and the pre-defined `cloud_deepseek` / `custom_openrouter` backends. **Verify the
cloud `model_name` against your provider's current model list before relying on it** — provider
model tags change, and the shipped defaults are examples, not guaranteed-live tags.

Not sure which model fits your machine? `kimcad models` examines your hardware (RAM,
CPU, a discrete GPU if present) and which models Ollama has pulled, then recommends one
— it only advises, it never changes your config. The model stays choosable via
`config/local.yaml` or `--backend`. (Mellum2 is the default planner — it won the v1.5-6
bake-off on every measured axis over the prior default, `qwen2.5:7b` (still selectable as
`local_qwen2_5`, and the fallback for boxes too small for Mellum2's ~9-10 GB RAM working set);
`gemma4:e4b` is the non-China fallback and still hosts the vision model. The earlier "Qwen
rejected" result tested `qwen2.5-coder`, a _code_ model — the general **instruct** model is
the right tool. Origin no longer factors in: KimCad runs fully offline.)

### Optional: the CadQuery engine (editable `.STEP` CAD export)

With [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/) installed, every **template-built part**
also offers an **editable `.STEP` (CAD) download** — the precision model, built by KimCad's
own trusted CadQuery twin of the template (never AI-written code) and exported lazily on
first download. Open it in Fusion 360, FreeCAD, SolidWorks and the like to keep modeling.
It's entirely optional — without CadQuery, KimCad behaves exactly as before and the app's
Settings card explains the one-time setup.

> History: Stage 8 also shipped an LLM-CadQuery _fallback generator_. Its realized lift
> measured **0** on the shipping model (`docs/benchmarks/stage-8-cadquery-backend.md`), so it
> was removed — and with it the only path that ever executed AI-written Python.

CadQuery runs in a separate interpreter as an **arm's-length worker** (like
OpenSCAD/OrcaSlicer). To enable it: install `cadquery` into a Python 3.13 environment —
in-app: **Settings → Editable CAD export** walks through it (`py -3.13 -m pip install
cadquery`); repo convention is a `.venv-cq313` next to `.venv`. KimCad auto-discovers it
(the repo-local worker venv first, then `py -3.13/-3.12/-3.11`, then `python3.x` on `PATH`).
Pin or disable it with `binaries.cadquery_python` in `config/local.yaml` (`null` = auto,
`false` = off, or an explicit interpreter path). Details in
[`docs/cadquery-backend.md`](docs/cadquery-backend.md).

## Usage

A bare prompt is treated as the `design` verb:

```
kimcad "a wall hook with two M4 screw holes 30 mm apart and a 35 mm arm"
```

KimCad asks at most one clarifying question, then writes OpenSCAD, renders and
validates the mesh, runs the Printability Gate against your printer/material, orients
and hardens the part, and writes the validated model plus a plain-text report under
`output/`. Override defaults with `--printer`, `--material`, or `--backend` (keys come
from `config/default.yaml`).

Add `--slice` to also turn a gate-passing part into a printable G-code 3MF — this is
the explicit print confirmation, so nothing is sliced without it:

```
kimcad "a 40 mm cable clip" --printer bambu_a1 --material pla --slice
```

The report then names the exact OrcaSlicer machine/process/filament profiles used and
the proven G-code line count. All three of Kim's printers — the Bambu P2S, the Bambu A1,
and the Elegoo Neptune 4 Max — are fully sliceable and proven end to end against the
bundled OrcaSlicer. (The configured build-volume _envelopes_ are the nominal published
sizes pending a physical confirmation — see the `VERIFY` notes in `config/default.yaml`;
the gate also caps the on-screen design to the slicer's verified usable footprint.) (If a
printer were ever configured without a process profile, a slice for it reports that cleanly
and the validated model is still produced.)

### Web UI

For a browser experience instead of the CLI:

```
kimcad web
```

This serves a local page at `http://127.0.0.1:8765` where you describe a part and get
back the design plan, the printability verdict, the target-vs-actual dimensions, and a
3D preview of the rendered model — the same pipeline as the CLI, driven from the
browser. Use `--demo` to serve a fixed sample part instantly with no model call (handy
for trying the interface), and `--port` to change the port.

**The 3D preview** is the real, gated mesh — the exact geometry that gets sliced, not a
stand-in. Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom, and right-click-drag to pan; the projected
width/depth/height pills and the orientation chip update as you turn it, so you can sanity-check
the part's size and how it sits on the bed before you slice. In `--demo` mode it shows the bundled
sample part (no model is called); otherwise it shows whatever you just described or reopened.

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` (your machine only) by default. `--host` can bind it
elsewhere, but do **not** expose it on a public interface without putting your own
authentication/proxy in front — it runs the pipeline for anyone who can reach it.

The page is a React + TypeScript single-page app, compiled by Vite into `src/kimcad/web/`
and served as static files by the Python server. **You do not need Node to run KimCad** —
the built UI is committed, so `kimcad web` works on its own. Node is needed only to _rebuild_
the UI after changing it: `npm --prefix frontend ci && npm --prefix frontend run build`
(details in `frontend/README.md`).

Once a part passes the gate you can pick a printer + material and, after an explicit
confirmation, generate a printable G-code 3MF and download it — slicing runs on the
already-validated mesh, so confirming a print never re-runs the model. The validated
3D model itself is always downloadable as the export fallback, including for printers
that can't yet produce G-code.

### Send to a printer

A sliced job can be sent to a **printer connection** through a swappable connector. Every
send requires explicit confirmation and refuses anything that isn't a proven slice. **No real
hardware is driven yet** (that's the final beta at Kim's) — every connector is exercised against
a runnable mock server on the dev box, so the path is _software-complete and mock-tested_, not
hardware-verified.

**Supported connections** (configure them under `connectors:` in `config/default.yaml`):

| Type        | Printers                                                                 | Config fields                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `loopback`  | the built-in **`mock`** simulation (no hardware)                         | —                                                                                                           |
| `octoprint` | any OctoPrint host                                                       | `base_url`, `api_key_env`                                                                                   |
| `moonraker` | Klipper via Moonraker — Creality-Klipper, Voron, RatRig, Mainsail/Fluidd | `base_url`, optional `api_key_env` (Moonraker often runs unauthenticated on a trusted LAN)                  |
| `prusalink` | Prusa via PrusaLink — MK4 / MK3.9 / MINI / XL                            | `base_url`, `api_key_env`, optional `storage` (default `usb`)                                               |
| `duet`      | RepRapFirmware / Duet 2/3 boards                                         | `base_url` (board IP), optional `api_key_env` (the board password if one is set)                            |
| `marlin`    | Marlin firmware — Ender-class + most consumer FDM                        | `base_url` = a USB serial port (`COM3`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`) **or** a `host:port` serial-over-network bridge     |
| `bambu`     | Bambu Lab, native LAN mode — P2S / A1 family (Stage 10)                  | `base_url` (printer IP), `serial`, `api_key_env` (the LAN access code), optional `use_ams` (default `true`) |

> **Duet / Marlin setup (KC-21):** `duet` drives RepRapFirmware boards over the classic `/rr_*`
> HTTP interface (no extra dependency; set the board password's env var only if one is configured).
> `marlin` drives Marlin firmware over its M-code line protocol — it uploads to the printer's SD
> card and starts the print from SD. A **`host:port`** target (a ser2net/ESP3D/relay bridge) needs
> nothing; a **USB serial port** target needs the **optional** `pyserial` package
> (`pip install pyserial` or `pip install "kimcad[serial]"`; without it a serial target reports
> that exact hint, never a crash). _Both are validated against conformance mocks; the first
> real-hardware run is the beta (#11). Job completion over the classic RRF/Marlin status surface is
> inferred from the print returning to idle after progress (not a per-file query), so treat the
> first terminal state as final; Marlin SD names are truncated to 8 characters, so designs sharing
> the first 8 alphanumerics reuse the same SD file._

> **Bambu setup (Stage 10):** the `bambu` connector drives the printer natively — MQTT-over-TLS
> for control, FTPS for the upload — via the **optional** `bambulabs-api` package
> (`pip install bambulabs-api`; without it the connection reports "not set up" with that exact
> hint, never a crash). On the printer, enable LAN/Developer mode and note the **Access Code**
> (_Settings → WLAN_) and **Serial** (_Settings → Device_); fill `base_url` + `serial` in
> `config/default.yaml` (the `bambu_p2s` / `bambu_a1` templates ship visible-but-unconfigured)
> and put the access code in the named env var. KimCad's sliced `.gcode.3mf` is Bambu's own
> format, so it's uploaded as-is and started by plate — like every connector, only after your
> explicit confirmation, and never for a gate-failed part. _(Validated against a mock transport;
> first real-hardware run is the Stage 11 beta at Kim's.)_

A connection's credential is always read from an **environment variable** (named by
`api_key_env`), never stored in config and never logged. Find it in your printer's settings —
OctoPrint: _Settings → API_; PrusaLink: the printer's _Settings → Network → PrusaLink_; Moonraker:
only if your `[authorization]` requires one. Each connection is flagged `simulated`, so the UI
labels a no-hardware connection honestly rather than narrating a mock send as a real print.

- **CLI:** `kimcad design "a cable clip" --send mock` slices and sends (the `--send` flag is the
  explicit confirmation). For a real printer: `--send octoprint` (shipped configured — just set
  its API-key env var), `--send bambu_p2s` / `--send bambu_a1` (shipped as templates — fill in
  the IP + serial and set the access-code env var; see the Bambu setup note above), or
  `--send moonraker` / `--send prusalink` once you've added that
  connector under `connectors:` and pointed `base_url` at your printer (the `config/default.yaml`
  entries for them are commented examples — uncomment and edit). If the printer is
  offline/unreachable, it says so and leaves the G-code on disk; a part that failed the
  printability gate is never sent.
- **Web:** after a slice, download the proven G-code or the model — or **send it straight from
  the browser** (Stage 10): pick a connection (simulated ones are labeled as test connections),
  confirm in the app's own dialog (KimCad never auto-starts a print), and follow the printer's
  live status; a not-sent outcome is a soft, typed message with the download as the fallback. A
  live **ready / not-ready badge** shows whether the printer connection is reachable. The CLI
  and MCP send too.
- **Agent / MCP:** `python -m kimcad.mcp_server` exposes the printer as MCP tools (list
  connections, status, capabilities, and a confirmation-gated `send_print`) so an agent can drive
  it. Runnable mock servers back each connector for offline testing: `python -m kimcad.mock_printer`
  (OctoPrint), `python -m kimcad.mock_moonraker`, `python -m kimcad.mock_prusalink`,
  `python -m kimcad.mock_duet`, and `python -m kimcad.mock_marlin`.

**Materials are per-printer-honest.** A printer is only offered the materials it has a verified
filament profile for — e.g. the Elegoo Neptune 4 Max ships no TPU profile, so TPU is _not_ offered
for it (rather than silently substituting another vendor's profile). The web UI says which
materials are hidden for the selected printer, and why.

**Connector response reasons.** A send or a not-ready status check carries a typed `reason` (so
the UI and HTTP-API consumers can branch on _why_, not on message text) plus a plain-English
`note`. On a live status snapshot the `reason` is derived from the printer's state; an
online-but-faulted printer (including a rejected credential) reads as `error` with a `detail`

To try the OctoPrint path with no hardware (the mock defaults to port `5000`, matching the
shipped `octoprint` connector's `base_url`):

1. Run `python -m kimcad.mock_printer` — it starts on `127.0.0.1:5000` and prints its
   `X-Api-Key` (default `mock-key`).
2. Set `OCTOPRINT_API_KEY=mock-key` in your environment.
3. `kimcad design "a cable clip" --send octoprint` — slices, then sends to the mock over the
   real OctoPrint REST path.

### The done-gate

Phase 1 is judged by a fixed benchmark — the ten Appendix B prompts in
`bench/prompts.yaml`. The gate passes at 8 / 10 dimensionally-correct, sliceable
results:

```
kimcad bench --min-success-rate 0.8
```

It exits non-zero when the batch misses the threshold, so it doubles as a CI check.

To compare two models head to head on that benchmark — completion, the three quality
axes (matches-request / correct-dimensions / slices-clean), and speed — run
`kimcad bakeoff --backends <a>,<b>`. It runs the benchmark once per backend (each model
measured in isolation) and recommends whether to switch the default; it only recommends
— flipping the configured default is a manual choice, never automatic.

### Local development checks

Lint and tests run locally as a pre-push gate. Enable the hook once per clone:

```
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

After that, every `git push` runs `scripts/ci.sh` and blocks the push if anything fails.
That gate is `ruff`, the full pytest suite (including the live OrcaSlicer slice), the
frontend Vitest suite, a committed-SPA build-reproducibility check, the installer-staging
smoke (`build_installer --stage-only` + `verify_install`), and — in release mode —
live-tool proof.

**CI runs on a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner** on the Windows build box
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), executing the _same_ `scripts/ci.sh`. This is deliberate:
the gate's live OpenSCAD / OrcaSlicer / CadQuery tests and the Windows installer build
can't run on hosted Linux runners, and the repo's hosted-minutes budget is limited (see
[the Stage 11 dispositions](docs/audits/stage-11/dispositions-2026-06-10.md)). The
self-hosted runner is the gate of record; the pre-push hook runs the identical script so a
push only reaches CI if it already passed locally.

## Platform notes

**Windows** ships the zero-terminal installer (the beta). **macOS and Linux run from source** —
`pip install`, then `kimcad web` for the browser UI. You install OpenSCAD/OrcaSlicer yourself and
point `config/local.yaml` at them (only rendering and slicing need them — the UI runs without).
_The from-source cross-platform path is code-verified (guarded imports, the cross-platform test
design) but not yet exercised on real mac/Linux hardware._ Zero-terminal **installers** for
macOS/Linux are scoped and deferred to a post-beta packaging lane: see
**[cross-platform packaging](docs/dev/cross-platform-packaging.md)** for the decision, the per-OS
recipe (briefcase `.app` / AppImage), and what's left to build.

## Community & contributing

KimCad is open source and welcomes use, issues, and pull requests.

- **[Discussions](../../discussions)** — questions, ideas, show-and-tell, and the
  real-hardware testing thread.
- **[Issues](../../issues)** — bug reports and concrete feature requests.
- **[Evaluation guide](../../docs/EVALUATE.md)** — how the build/test gate works.
- **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** — how to report a security concern.

A note on scope: real-printer validation happens on the maintainer's hardware during the
beta. If you run KimCad against a printer it lists as _API-validated_ (not yet
_metal-validated_), your report in Discussions is genuinely valuable — see
[first-hardware-contact](docs/beta/first-hardware-contact.md) for what to watch.
