# KimCad HTTP API reference

The local web UI is a thin SPA over this JSON API, served by `kimcad web` on
`http://127.0.0.1:8765` (loopback-only by default; see the security note at the end). Every
endpoint below is the real contract the shipped SPA uses — there is no hidden surface.

Conventions:

- All bodies are JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`) unless noted (the two image
  endpoints take raw bytes; the artifact endpoints return binary downloads).
- Errors are typed statuses with a human-readable `{"error": "..."}` body — a recoverable
  condition (model down, tool missing, stale design) is **never a 500**.
- `<rid>` is the integer design id the server assigns per design (returned inside
  `mesh_url`). State is per-server-run: ids reset on restart (saved designs persist —
  see *My Designs*).

## Design

### POST `/api/design`

Turn a plain-English prompt into a designed, validated part.

Request:

```json
{
  "prompt": "a wall hook, 60 mm tall, holds a coat",
  "history": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
  "experimental": false,
  "job_id": "optional-progress-token"
}
```

`history` (optional) carries the refine conversation. `experimental: true` permits the
LLM-OpenSCAD generator for this request when no template fits (otherwise the server OFFERS
it instead of running it).

Response (`200`, abridged to the load-bearing fields):

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "has_mesh": true,
  "mesh_url": "/api/mesh/3",
  "step_url": "/api/step/3",
  "template": "wall_hook",
  "params": [{"name": "plate_w", "label": "Plate width", "value": 25.0,
              "min": 12.0, "max": 120.0, "step": 1.0, "unit": "mm",
              "integer": false, "axis": "X"}],
  "plan": {"object_type": "wall_hook", "summary": "...", "target_bbox_mm": [25, 39, 60]},
  "report": {"gate_status": "pass", "headline": "...", "backend": "openscad",
             "dims": [], "findings": [], "readiness": {}}
}
```

`status` values: `completed`, `gate_failed`, `render_failed`, `plan_failed`,
`clarification_needed` (+ `clarification` text), `model_unavailable` (the local AI isn't
running — recoverable), `needs_experimental` (no template fits; the experimental generator
is offered, not run).

STEP export fields: `step_url` is present for a template part when the optional CadQuery
engine is installed (the file builds lazily on first download). `step_offer: "settings"`
appears instead when the part *could* export STEP but no engine is installed.

### GET `/api/design/progress/<job_id>`

Coarse phase of an in-flight design run (`planning` → `generating` → `rendering` →
`validating`); `{"phase": null}` once it resolves. Poll-friendly.

### POST `/api/render/<rid>`

Live-slider re-render of a template part at new parameter values — deterministic, no model
call.

Request: `{"values": {"plate_w": 30, "plate_h": 80, "arm_proj": 40}}`

Response: the same shape as `/api/design`, plus `adjusted_params` listing any value the
engine clamped (`{"name", "requested", "applied"}`), and a cache-busted
`mesh_url (...?v=N)`. Re-rendering invalidates the design's cached slice, G-code, and STEP
(the old shape can never be downloaded or sent).

### POST `/api/reverse-import`

Recover a trusted, editable template design from an uploaded mesh when it confidently matches a
known part family. This endpoint accepts raw STL, 3MF, or OBJ bytes with the original filename in
`X-TinkerQuarry-Filename`.

The importer is conservative: it first measures the uploaded mesh, finds a known-family envelope,
rebuilds that trusted family, then compares bounding box, volume, and surface area before
registering an editable design. If the file is unreadable, no family matches, or the rebuilt twin
does not match the measured geometry closely enough, the response is a recoverable `200` with
`status: "render_failed"` or `status: "needs_experimental"`, `has_mesh: false`, and an `error`
message. Rejected imports do not register a mesh id.

STEP/STP files are not accepted here. STEP remains an export format from trusted template twins,
not a reverse-to-parametric import format.

---

## Artifacts

### GET `/api/mesh/<rid>` · GET `/api/gcode/<id>` · GET `/api/step/<rid>`

Binary downloads: the rendered mesh (`.stl`), the sliced print file (`.gcode.3mf`), and the
editable CAD (`.step`). The STEP for a template part builds **lazily on the first request**
(a few seconds) from the family's trusted CadQuery twin, then caches; `404` when the id is
unknown, the part has no STEP source, or no CadQuery engine is present.

---

## Slice & print

### POST `/api/slice/<rid>`

Slice a gate-passing part for a printer + material. The POST is the explicit confirmation.

Request: `{"printer": "bambu_p2s", "material": "pla"}`

Response: `{"sliced": true, "gcode_url": "/api/gcode/3", "estimate": "...", "machine": "...",
"process": "...", "filament": "..."}` — or `{"sliced": false, "reason":
"no_profile" | "failed" | "stale", "note": "..."}`. A gate-**failed** part is refused
server-side regardless of what the client claims. Slices are cached per
(design, printer, material) and invalidated by any re-render.

### POST `/api/send/<rid>`

Send an already-sliced part to a configured printer connection. The POST is the explicit
per-send confirmation; a gate-failed or never-sliced part is refused. Responds with the
connector's typed result (including `simulated: true` for the built-in mock — a simulated
send is never narrated as a real print).

### POST `/api/print-outcome/<rid>`

Record the optional real-world result after a **real** hardware send. The server rejects
non-skip outcomes until that design id has successfully gone through `/api/send/<rid>` with
a non-simulated connector in the current server process. The web UI offers
`clean`, `issues`, `failed`, or `skip`; `skip` records nothing. Non-skip answers append a
coarse local-only Smart Mesh history row (`print_outcome`) so KimCad can learn from actual
prints without storing prompt text or geometry.

Request: `{"outcome": "clean" | "issues" | "failed" | "skip"}`

Response: `{"recorded": true, "outcome": "issues"}` (or `recorded:false` for skip).

Two distinct refusals guard this endpoint, by status code:

- **`404`** — the `<rid>` is **unknown** in the current server run (no such design, or ids reset on
  restart): `{"error": "That design is no longer available."}`. An arbitrary/probed id lands here.
- **`409`** — the design **is known** but was **not** sent to real hardware in this process (never
  sent, or only sent via a simulated/mock connector):
  `{"error": "Record an outcome after a real printer send."}`.

So the unknown-id case is a 404 (checked first) and the no-real-send gate is a 409; both refuse and
record nothing. Outcomes are accepted only after a non-simulated `/api/send/<rid>` in the current
server process.

### GET `/api/connectors` · GET `/api/connector-status/<name>` · GET/POST `/api/connections`

`connectors` lists configured connections (`name`, `simulated`, `configured`).
`connector-status` is the live readiness of one printer (`ready` / `busy` / `offline` /
`needs_setup` — statuses, never 5xx). `connections` GET lists each connection's effective
non-secret fields (+ which env var holds its secret and whether it's set); POST saves the
overlay for one named connection (`{"name": "...", "base_url": "...", "serial": "...",
"use_ams": true}`) — secrets never pass through this surface in either direction.

---

## Image on-ramps

### POST `/api/photo-seed` · POST `/api/sketch-seed`

Body: the raw image bytes (not JSON). The LOCAL vision model reads the photo (or
dimensioned sketch) into an editable text seed for the normal design flow — the image
never leaves the machine and is not persisted. Response: `{"seed": "..."}`; an unreadable
image or vision failure is a clean `422` with a typed hint (e.g. the vision model isn't
pulled yet), never a 500.

---

## My Designs (saved designs)

### GET `/api/designs` · POST `/api/designs/save` · GET `/api/designs/<id>` · POST `/api/designs/<id>/{rename,delete,duplicate}` · POST `/api/designs/import`

The persistent store (`~/.kimcad/designs/`). `save` takes `{"design_id": <rid>, "name":
"...", "thumb": "<dataURL>", "saved_id": "optional — overwrite an existing save"}` and
returns the stable `saved_id`. `GET /api/designs/<id>` returns the saved snapshot (the SPA
reopens it through the normal design flow, re-validating against the current printer);
`/thumb` serves the thumbnail. `import` accepts a previously exported design file. Mutating a
saved design is a **POST** sub-route — `POST /api/designs/<id>/rename`, `/delete`, `/duplicate`
(there is no `DELETE` verb; the SPA's `deleteDesign` calls `POST .../delete`).

---

## Settings & status

### GET/POST `/api/settings`

GET returns the Settings payload: printer/material choices + effective defaults, cloud
opt-in state (`cloud_enabled`, `cloud_model`, `has_cloud_key`, `cloud_key_masked` — the
key is returned **only masked**, never in full), `experimental_enabled`, and
`key_storage` (`"keyring"` = the OS credential store; `"file"` = the disclosed fallback).
POST merges any of those fields (validated; unknown values are a `400`, a typo'd field is
an error, `{"reset": true}` clears everything) and returns the new state with a `saved`
flag that is honest about whether the write stuck. The OpenRouter key is stored in the OS
credential store at rest.

### GET `/api/options`

The printer + material catalog the UI offers (each printer with its build volume and
`sliceable` flag) plus the effective defaults.

### GET `/api/templates`

The part-library catalog the browser modal renders, derived live from the template registry
(the single source — the catalog grows here automatically as families are added). Returns
`{"families": [...]}`, each family:

```json
{
  "name": "tube",
  "summary": "A ring / cylindrical spacer or standoff.",
  "examples": ["tube", "ring", "spacer", "standoff"],
  "seed": "a tube",
  "param_count": 3,
  "tier": "benchmarked"
}
```

`seed` is the article-correct prompt the modal submits through the normal design flow (the
library has no separate seeding path). `tier` is the honesty label: `benchmarked`
(what-you-set-is-what-you-get) or `baseline` (real, gate-verified geometry with a fitness
caveat to verify before real use). The tier is display-only — every family is verified
against its analytic bounding box by a real render regardless of label.

### GET `/api/model-status`

The AI layer's health: `backend` (`local`/`cloud`), `model`, `running`, `model_present`,
and the vision model's presence (`vision_model`, `vision_present`). Never echoes the cloud
key.

### POST `/api/model-pull` · GET `/api/model-pull/progress`

Start (or report) the in-app download of KimCad's own models into a LOCAL loopback Ollama —
the pull list is fixed server-side, never caller-supplied. Idempotent; progress reports
per-model `{status, completed, total}`.

### GET `/api/health` (· `/api/health?recheck=1`)

Tool + app health: `{"version": "...", "openscad": true, "orcaslicer": true,
"cadquery": false}`. With `recheck=1` the server drops its cached CadQuery probe and
discovers fresh (the Settings card's *check again* after the one-time engine install).

---

## Security model (summary)

The server binds **loopback-only** by default and refuses a non-loopback host without an
explicit `--allow-remote` acknowledgment (it then prints a no-auth warning). Secrets
(cloud key, printer access codes) never appear in any response, log, or error; the design
pipeline's generated code runs through static sanitizers and arm's-length worker
processes. Full detail: [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) and
[`cadquery-backend.md`](cadquery-backend.md).

**Session token on state-changing requests (KC-26).** The server issues a fresh random token
each boot, injects it into the page shell (`<meta name="kimcad-session-token">`), and the SPA
returns it as the `X-KimCad-Session` header on every POST. A state-changing request without the
matching token (constant-time compared) is refused `403`. This blocks a drive-by **cross-origin**
POST from a malicious web page, in that order of weight: it cannot *read* this same-origin token
(so it can't supply a valid header at all); a request that simply omits the header is refused
outright (empty ≠ token); and trying to *fake* the header forces a CORS preflight the server
doesn't satisfy. A few **side-effecting GETs** that can't carry the token because they're navigations/reads use the
browser's `Sec-Fetch-Site` header instead — but the two cases differ:

- `/api/step/<id>` (a real CadQuery build) is **hard-refused** `403` cross-origin — a drive-by page
  can't trigger the side-effecting build.
- `/api/health?recheck=1` **skips only the side-effecting CPU re-probe** for a cross-origin caller and
  still answers `200` with **cached** health (a harmless read). The protected invariant is "no
  cross-origin-triggered re-probe," not refusing the response outright.

Ordinary GETs are never gated.

This is deliberate defense-in-depth, **not** full CSRF protection, and **not authentication**:
KimCad is a single-user loopback app with no cookie-based session to forge, so a constant per-boot
bearer the attacker can't read is the proportionate measure (per-request form nonces and
`SameSite` cookies would add machinery without a matching threat). Note it does **not** authenticate
a *remote* client on `--allow-remote`: any client that can load the page over HTTP reads the token
from the shell, so `--allow-remote` remains unauthenticated (the CLI warns of this) — the token only
stops a blind cross-origin POST. Because the token rotates per boot, a tab left open across a server
restart will `403`; the SPA detects this (`reason:"session"`) and shows a one-click **Reload**
banner — reloading re-fetches the freshly injected token.
