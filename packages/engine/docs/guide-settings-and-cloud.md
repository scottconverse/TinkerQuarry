# Settings, and the cloud opt-in

Everything in **Settings** (the gear in the top bar) is local preference — KimCad works
fully without touching any of it. This guide explains what each section does, and exactly
what the optional cloud acceleration sends and stores.

## Your printer and material

The defaults every new design is checked and sliced against. Changing them here changes
the build-volume check, the wall-thickness rule, and which slicing profile is used.
A printer marked "no slicer profile yet" can still be designed for — it just can't
produce a print file yet.

## The AI model

A health readout, not a menu: KimCad runs two tested local models, both via Ollama —
Qwen3.5-9B (`qwen3.5:9b`), which designs your parts, and a small
dedicated vision model
(`qwen2.5vl:3b`) that reads photos and sketches. Settings shows whether Ollama is running
and the design model is pulled, with a re-check button — the same status the start page
and setup wizard show. `kimcad models` in a terminal (or the setup wizard) confirms both
models at once; if photos and sketches fail while everything else works, the vision model
is the one to check — Settings shows its own row for it (downloaded / not downloaded), and
either the setup wizard's **Download now** or `ollama pull qwen2.5vl:3b` fetches it.

## Cloud acceleration (optional — off by default)

KimCad's local AI does everything. Turning on cloud acceleration lets KimCad *also* send
design requests to a bigger model through OpenRouter, which can help with unusual parts —
at a privacy cost you should make knowingly:

- **What it sends, when enabled and configured:** the text of your design request (your
  prompt and the conversation around it). **Never your photo or sketch** — the image
  on-ramps always stay local, read by the local vision model. Nothing is sent until you've turned the toggle on, saved a key, *and*
  chosen a cloud model.
- **What it costs:** OpenRouter bills your key per request. KimCad doesn't meter or cap it.
- **Where your key lives:** in **Windows Credential Manager** — your computer's secure
  credential store — not in a plain file. (If that store isn't available, KimCad falls
  back to its settings file and *tells you so* right under the key field.) The key is
  shown only masked after saving, and "Reset all settings" removes it from the credential
  store too.
- **Turning it off:** flip the toggle; local keeps working exactly as before. The
  **Remove** button next to your saved key deletes it (from the credential store too).

## The experimental generator

Off by default. When a part doesn't match any of KimCad's built-in shape families, this
lets the AI write raw CAD code for it — more flexible, less predictable. Every result
still goes through the same printability checks; nothing skips the gate.

## Reset

"Reset all settings" returns everything above to fresh-install defaults and deletes the
saved cloud key (including from the credential store). Your saved designs are not touched
— they live in My Designs, not here.
