"""KC-5 (#10) — CVE/advisory status for the pinned third-party binaries.

``pip-audit`` (CI workflow) covers the Python dependency tree; this covers the BINARIES the
installer bundles: OpenSCAD and OrcaSlicer (PrintProof3D is first-party; Ollama is
installed/updated in user space by its own installer, not pinned by KimCad).

The check is a curated, reviewed table — not a live feed — so the gate stays offline and
deterministic. **The bump process** (documented here, referenced from CONTRIBUTING):

1. When changing a pin in ``scripts/fetch_tools.py``, search NVD + GitHub Security
   Advisories for the tool at the new version.
2. Record every advisory that exists for (or before) the pinned version in the table
   below, with an exposure assessment for HOW KIMCAD USES THE TOOL.
3. ``blocking=True`` for any advisory whose vulnerable surface KimCad actually exposes —
   the gate then fails until the pin is bumped or the exposure is closed.
4. Update ``reviewed`` to the review date. The gate fails when a pinned version has no
   review entry at all, so a silent bump can't skip the process.

Run: ``python scripts/check_binary_advisories.py`` (wired into scripts/ci.sh).
