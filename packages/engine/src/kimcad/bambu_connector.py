"""Bambu Lab native send-to-printer connector (ROADMAP Stage 10 — the gap left from Stage 3).

Drives a Bambu printer (P2S / A1 family) in LAN mode over the printer's own protocols —
MQTT-over-TLS:8883 for state/control and FTPS for the file upload — via the **optional**
``bambulabs-api`` package (MIT). The package has the same graceful-absence posture as
CadQuery/PrintProof3D: when it isn't installed, :func:`kimcad.connectors.build_connector`
reports the connection unconfigured with the exact ``pip install`` to fix it — never a crash.

LAN-mode prerequisites (the UI copy and config template explain them): the printer's
**access code** (Settings → WLAN on the printer; supplied via an env var, never stored in
config) and its **serial number**, with the printer and this machine on the same network.
KimCad's sliced output is a ``*.gcode.3mf`` — Bambu's own project format — so the file is
uploaded AS-IS (no G-code extraction) and started by filename + plate.

The job starts ONLY through the shared :func:`~kimcad.printer_connector.ensure_sendable`
gate (explicit ``confirm=True`` + a proven motion-bearing slice), like every connector.

Tested wholly against an injected fake transport (``printer_factory``); no real hardware is
driven until Kim's beta (Stage 11) — the same posture the other connectors shipped with.
