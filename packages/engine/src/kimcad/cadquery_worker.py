"""CadQuery execution worker — runs OUT OF PROCESS in its own interpreter.

KimCad targets Python 3.13 and CadQuery runs on 3.13 too — the out-of-process split is a
SECURITY-ISOLATION choice (untrusted generated code stays in its own interpreter with
restricted builtins), not a version constraint; CadQuery is shelled out exactly the way
OpenSCAD and OrcaSlicer are (arm's-length subprocess; spec §6.4/§12).

This file is deliberately **stdlib + cadquery only** — it must import cleanly under the
worker interpreter (which has cadquery but not kimcad), so it NEVER imports ``kimcad``
or anything from the app venv. The in-process side (:mod:`kimcad.cadquery_runner`)
writes the sanitized script to a temp file and invokes::

    <py3.13> path/to/cadquery_worker.py   # request JSON on stdin, RESULT JSON to result_path

Protocol
--------
Request  (stdin, one JSON object):
    {"script_path": "...", "stl_path": "...", "step_path": "..."|null,
     "result_path": "...", "tessellation_mm": 0.1}
Result   (written to ``result_path`` as one JSON object — NOT stdout, see Security #3):
    {"ok": true,  "bbox_mm": [x, y, z], "stl_bytes": N, "step_bytes": N|null}
    {"ok": false, "kind": "blocked|exec|empty|export|protocol", "error": "..."}

Security (the generated CadQuery is untrusted LLM output)
--------------------------------------------------------
There are two layers, with an HONEST division of what each one independently guarantees:

1. **Static sanitizer (the PRIMARY layer)** — :func:`kimcad.cadquery_runner.sanitize_cadquery`
   rejects dangerous source before it reaches this worker: non-cadquery/math imports; banned
   names/attributes (``os``, ``open``, ``system`` …); ALL ``__dunder__`` names, attributes,
   and string-subscript keys; frame/function introspection attributes (``gi_frame``,
   ``f_builtins``, ``func_globals`` …); and ``str.format`` field pivots. This is the only layer
   that closes the introspection / ``__globals__`` escape class — see point 3.
2. **Worker runtime (the SECONDARY layer)** — the script runs with a **restricted
   ``__builtins__``** (no ``open``/``eval``/``exec``/``compile``/``input``; an ``__import__``
   that returns the cadquery FACADE for ``import cadquery``, the real ``math`` for ``import
   math``, and **raises ``ImportError`` for every other import**) against a **geometry-only
   facade** of cadquery — every top-level cadquery SUBMODULE (``exporters``, ``importers``,
   ``occ_impl`` …) is
   stripped, so no module object is in scope to pivot through to ``os`` (the ``cq.exporters.os``
   class). The script does **no file I/O at all**: it assigns a ``result`` object; this worker
   does every export. The JSON result is written to a dedicated ``result_path`` file (never
   stdout), so a native fd-1 write cannot corrupt the contract.

3. **What the worker layer canNOT independently do**, by design of CPython: a cadquery facade
   function still carries its real, unrestricted ``__builtins__`` inside ``__globals__``, so a
   script reaching ``some_func.__globals__["__builtins__"]`` would get full ``import`` power.
   Every such path needs a dunder or an introspection attribute, which the static sanitizer
   blocks — so that escape class is closed by layer 1, not layer 2. As defence in depth, the worker
   now also DENIES NETWORK egress before running the script (:func:`_deny_network` neutralizes the
   socket constructors), so even a smuggled socket reference can't exfiltrate at the Python level —
   a geometry worker needs no network. The residual (a pure-native Winsock bypass, and OS-level
   working-dir FS confinement) needs admin/platform infra and stays tracked as a later hardening.

Net: this is sanitizer-anchored defence in depth, not a perfect in-process sandbox. The ultimate
boundary is that KimCad runs locally on the user's own machine — the same trust model as
executing generated OpenSCAD.
