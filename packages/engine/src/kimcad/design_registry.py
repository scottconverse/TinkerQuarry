"""The per-design server state, extracted from the webapp closure (ENG-004, Stage 9).

One object owns every per-design registry/cache plus the lock and the three LOAD-BEARING
protocols the 2026-06-09 audit flagged as "correct but enforced by comments":

1. **Eviction in lockstep** — dropping a design id must clear EVERY registry it appears in
   AND its on-disk directory (:meth:`evict_locked`); forgetting one registry leaks state.
2. **Cap enforcement** — the mesh registry is LRU-bounded; evicting past the cap must run
   the full lockstep eviction (:meth:`enforce_caps_locked`).
3. **The geometry-version protocol** — a re-render bumps the version; a slice captures the
   version it sliced and is registered ONLY if it still matches (:meth:`bump_version_locked`
   / :meth:`register_gcode_locked` / :meth:`cache_slice_locked`), so a re-render landing
   mid-slice can never leave stale G-code registered.

Methods suffixed ``_locked`` REQUIRE ``self.lock`` to be held (they run inside the
handlers' existing multi-field transactions); the others take the lock themselves.
The webapp's handlers access this state directly as ``reg.<field>`` under ``reg.lock``
(the Stage-9 transitional aliases were flattened at Stage-10-start as scheduled).
