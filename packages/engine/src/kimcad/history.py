"""Stage 7 — the Smart Mesh learning store (spec §6.12).

Smart Mesh's *history* layer: a local-first record of the parts this install has built, used to add
an honest "compared to your past parts" line to the readiness card. The store is plain local JSON
and entirely **best-effort** — a missing or corrupt file degrades to *no* history (the card simply
omits the comparison), and a write failure never breaks a build. Nothing ever leaves the machine.

The comparison is deliberately **factual, not flattering**: it states how this part's readiness
score ranks against prior parts ("Stronger than 7 of your 9 past parts"), and only claims a
personal best when the score strictly beats every prior one. With no prior history it returns
``None`` — the card shows nothing rather than inventing a baseline.

Writes are serialized + atomic (a process-wide lock + temp-file ``os.replace``) so concurrent
designs under the threaded web server can't lose records or leave a half-written file. Two separate
KimCad *processes* racing could still drop a record — acceptable for an advisory store — but the
file is never corrupted.
