"""Hardware- and availability-aware LLM model advisor (Stage 6).

The model KimCad runs is **choosable, never hardwired** -- `config/default.yaml` defines
named backends, `config/local.yaml` overrides per machine, and `--backend` overrides per
run (see `kimcad.config`). This module adds the missing half: it *examines the machine*
(RAM, and a discrete GPU's VRAM if present) and *what's installed* (the models Ollama has
pulled) and **recommends** the best model that actually fits -- or, if the box could run
something better, suggests pulling it. It only ever advises; it never rewrites config.

Everything is best-effort and side-effect-free to probe: a missing `nvidia-smi`, an Ollama
that isn't running, or an unreadable `/proc/meminfo` degrade to "unknown", never an
exception. The decision function :func:`recommend` is pure (hardware + installed list +
catalog in, a recommendation out), so it's unit-tested without touching the real machine.

The catalog's RAM floors are **conservative heuristics** (roughly the q4-quantized weight
size plus headroom), not vendor specs -- they're tunable and exist to keep the advisor from
recommending a model that won't load. The model *origins* (who trained it) are factual and
matter for Scott's "keep a non-China alternative" requirement.

# prior default qwen2.5:7b on every harness axis (9/10 completed, 3/10 graded, 61.2s mean). An
# independent review then proved the grader feature-blind (Mellum2 b02: 8 holes where 4 were
# asked, 60mm legs declared inside a 40mm bbox, still scored "completed"); a fidelity re-grade tied
# Mellum2 to the incumbent, and JetBrains' own technical report corroborated the miss (BS-Bench
# false-premise detection 14-24 vs Qwen3.5's 56-70 -- the authors' own admission their SFT/RL
# signal "leans toward compliance," the wrong trait for a planner that must reject contradictory
# dimensions). Deep research across the published record then ranked Qwen3.5-9B first for this
# task profile (IFEval 83.9, BFCL v3 70.5, StructEval 90.96 vs the incumbent's 84.40); the owner
# chose to switch on that record. Full history: docs/benchmarks/stage-v156-model-bakeoff.md.
# qwen3.5:9b's RAM floor (~7-8 GB working set) is SMALLER than Mellum2's (~9-10 GB) — a box that
# can't fit it still downshifts to qwen2.5:7b, then qwen2.5:3b, same as before.

# fallback); llama3.1:8b 0/4 (it produced correct plans wrapped in prose the parser rejected — the
