"""Send-to-printer connector abstraction (spec §6.10 / ROADMAP Stage 2).

KimCad never drives a printer directly from the pipeline. Instead a part that has been
sliced to a G-code-bearing 3MF is handed to a **connector** — a thin, swappable adapter
to one printer's control surface (OctoPrint, Moonraker/Klipper, …). This module is the
abstraction every connector implements, plus an in-memory ``LoopbackConnector`` that
exercises the contract with no network and no hardware. (The MCP server in
:mod:`kimcad.mcp_server` is a *consumer* of this abstraction, not a connector itself.)

Two safety properties live here, not in the leaf connectors:

- **Explicit per-send confirmation.** :meth:`PrinterConnector.send` refuses to start a job
  unless the caller passes ``confirm=True``; a missing/false (or merely truthy) confirmation
  raises :class:`NotConfirmed`. The connector cannot be tricked into printing without an
  explicit human-confirmed signal, exactly as G-code generation is gated in Stage 1.
- **The job must be a real, proven slice.** ``send`` validates that the file exists and is a
  G-code-bearing 3MF (via :func:`kimcad.slicer.prove_gcode_3mf`) before it leaves the machine,
  so a connector never uploads an empty or non-printable file.

Real printing waits for Kim's beta (Stage 10). Everything here is tested against mocks /
emulators on the dev box; no connector talks to physical hardware yet.

    """Base class for send-to-printer failures.

    Carries a machine-readable ``reason`` (so a caller can branch on *why* a send failed
    instead of string-matching the message) and a ``user_message`` (plain, non-developer
    phrasing that is safe to show an end user). ``str(self)`` stays the developer-facing
    detail, which may name an env var, a URL, etc.

    Reason vocabulary — the single source of truth; keep the README "Connector response reasons"
    table and any client that branches on ``reason`` in sync with this set. (The web UI renders a
    live status snapshot by its ``state``/``online`` fields and a build failure by ``reason``, so
    it branches on the relevant subset, not the full enum.):

    - ``"config"``       — misconfigured connection (missing API key / base_url).
    - ``"unknown"``      — no configured connection by that name (a typo, not a setup task).
    - ``"auth"``         — reachable but the printer rejected the credentials (bad API key).
    - ``"offline"``      — the printer could not be reached.
    - ``"busy"``         — the printer refused the job because it's busy (retry when idle).
    - ``"bad_response"`` — the endpoint answered but not with the expected JSON (wrong device).
    - ``"error"``        — generic / uncategorized failure (the base default).

    ``"not_confirmed"`` (``ensure_sendable`` raises it when a send lacks an explicit
    ``confirm=True``) is an INTERNAL guard — caught before any network call, never returned to a
    client, so the README "Connector response reasons" table omits it (DOC-001). The response
    reasons above appear on ``/api/connector-status`` (``config``/``unknown`` from build;
