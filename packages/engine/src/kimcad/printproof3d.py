"""Stage 7 — PrintProof3D arm's-length integration (spec §6.11 / §6.12).

PrintProof3D is the owner's MIT Rust validation **engine**. KimCad runs it at arm's length — a
subprocess, never linked — to validate a rendered mesh against the chosen printer + material, and
parses its ``ValidationReport`` JSON into the typed :class:`~kimcad.smart_mesh.PrintProofReport`
that Smart Mesh folds into the readiness verdict. The CLI contract:

    printproof3d validate-model --model <mesh> --printer <printer.json> --material <material.json>
        -o <report.json>

PrintProof3D needs its own printer/material profile JSON (its schema, not KimCad's), so this module
generates a minimal-but-valid profile from KimCad's :class:`~kimcad.config.Printer` /
:class:`~kimcad.config.Material` — the mesh-relevant fields (build volume, nozzle, temps) come from
KimCad; capability flags that don't affect model validation get conservative constants.

**Best-effort + injectable.** :func:`validate_model` returns ``None`` whenever the engine isn't
configured/present, the run produces no report, or the report doesn't parse — so Smart Mesh keeps
working on KimCad's own gate (honestly, at lower confidence). It **never raises**. The run is gated
on the *parsed report file*, not the exit code: PrintProof3D exits non-zero on a fail verdict, which
is a normal result, not a wrapper failure. The subprocess runner is injectable so the wrapper is
unit-tested offline without the binary.
