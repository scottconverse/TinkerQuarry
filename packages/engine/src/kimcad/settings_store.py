"""Stage 8.5 Slice 6 — the user settings store.

A small, local-first, best-effort persister for the choices the in-app Settings screen owns:
the default printer + material today, and (later slices) the LLM backend, the cloud opt-in, and
the experimental-generator toggle. It lives in the per-user home (``~/.kimcad/settings.json``),
never the repo, so it persists across sessions and nothing leaves the machine.

Same posture as the history + designs stores: every read/write is wrapped so a failure degrades
(the UI falls back to the shipped config defaults / a save no-ops) rather than ever breaking a
build. Writes are serialized + atomic (a temp file + ``os.replace``) so a concurrent reader on the
threaded web server never sees a half-write.

The store is a dumb key/value JSON bag. Validation (e.g. "is this a known printer key?") is the
caller's job — the web layer has the config to check against; the store just persists.
