"""Stage 11 Slice 11.1 — the windowed app shell (`kimcad shell`).

A thin WebView2 window (pywebview, `edgechromium` backend — verified on this stack:
pywebview 6.2.1 / pythonnet 3.1.0 / the Win11-bundled WebView2 runtime, page-load proven)
over the EXISTING local server. The shell is a wrapper, never a fork of the serving logic:

- the server is the same handler `kimcad web` uses, bound to ``127.0.0.1`` on a **stable
  shell port** (8766, scanning a few up if taken — SHELL-001: the origin must be stable
  across launches or the SPA's localStorage — the first-run flag, client UI state — resets
  every time; an ephemeral port would silently wipe it each launch);
- the window's ``closed`` event shuts the server down — closing the app leaves no orphan
  process serving the design pipeline;
- external links open in the user's default browser, never inside the app window —
  exposed to the SPA as the ``window.pywebview.api.open_external`` bridge (the js_api).

pywebview is a Windows runtime dependency of the SHELL only: when it isn't importable
(a from-source install that never needed it), ``kimcad shell`` degrades to one friendly
line pointing at ``kimcad web`` — the browser path always works (graceful absence, the
CadQuery posture).
