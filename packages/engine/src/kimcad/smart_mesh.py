"""Stage 7 — Smart Mesh readiness (spec §6.12).

Smart Mesh is KimCad's **synthesis + history** layer on top of the per-artifact validation
engine. The engine today is the Printability Gate (`kimcad.printability`); when the deeper
geometric / G-code validator **PrintProof3D** is available (Slice 2), its report folds in too.
Smart Mesh ingests what KimCad already knows about a built part — the gate findings, the mesh
integrity stats, the chosen material — plus an *optional* PrintProof3D report, and produces a
single readiness verdict the UI renders as a report card: a 0-100 **score**, a plain **verdict**,
a **confidence**, the **risks**, concrete **recommendations**, and (Slice 5) a **comparison** to
similar past prints. Per the spec, *PrintProof3D is the engine Smart Mesh is built on, not Smart
Mesh itself.*

:func:`assess_readiness` is pure — inputs in, a :class:`MeshReadiness` out — so it is fully
unit-tested without a model, a slicer, or PrintProof3D. The PrintProof3D report is modeled here
as a typed, optional input (:class:`PrintProofReport`); Slice 2 adds the subprocess wrapper that
produces it.
