"""Deterministic template engine (Stage 5, spec §6.3 — the critical-path module).

The Stage-1..4 engine writes OpenSCAD with the LLM: every render is a model call, so
"drag a slider and watch it change" is impossible (each nudge would round-trip the
model). This module is the deterministic alternative — a registry of *parametric
template families* built on the proven `library/*.scad` modules. The planner picks a
family by ``object_type``; the family maps the plan's named dimensions onto typed,
range-bounded parameters; and emitting OpenSCAD is a pure string substitution (no model
in the loop). That makes a re-render a sub-second, fully-local pass and is what lets
named live sliders re-render instantly.

The LLM-writes-OpenSCAD path stays as the tiered *fallback* for prompts no template
covers — it is never the live-slider path.

Design notes:
- Families are pure DATA (pydantic models), so the same definition drives codegen,
  bbox prediction, and the JSON the web UI needs to render sliders — no per-family code.
- A family's :class:`ParamSpec` ``name`` is exactly the underlying module's parameter
  name, so :func:`emit_scad` is generic: ``module(name=value, ...)``.
- Each family declares its bounding box analytically (:class:`BBoxTerm`), so the gate
  can be targeted at what the template *intends* to build and a render that drifts from
  it fails loudly (mirrors ``tests/test_library_modules.py``).

All linear dimensions are millimeters.

# --- The built-in families ---------------------------------------------------------

# envelope, not a guess.

# A printable linear dimension. QA-502: the X/Y FOOTPRINT is capped at the reference P2S/A1's
# *sliceable* envelope, not the 256 mm physical bed — OrcaSlicer's auto-arrange reserves edge
# clearance (the P2S profile's extruder_clearance_radius is 72 mm), so a ~200 mm footprint fails to
# arrange while ~170 mm reliably slices. Capping the param max here clamps BOTH the slider and an
# LLM-derived value (via _finalize), so a part can't pass the gate then fail in OrcaSlicer. Height
# (Z) is free to the bed height. (The big Elegoo Neptune 4 Max's larger plate is a Stage-10
# per-printer-envelope refinement; 170 is the safe default for the reference machines.)
# QA-502: EVERY outer dimension is capped at the reference P2S/A1's sliceable footprint side
# (~170 mm), not the 256 mm bed. Two reasons compound: (1) OrcaSlicer's auto-arrange reserves edge
# clearance, so the usable plate is well under the physical bed (a 200 mm side fails to arrange);
# and (2) the printability auto-orient ROTATES the part for the best print orientation, so ANY axis
# can become a footprint dimension — height included. Capping all three at 170 guarantees the
# oriented footprint is <= 170x170, which slices (a 170x170x170 cube is verified to slice end to
# end through orient). A per-printer 3-D envelope (the big Elegoo Max plate) is a Stage-10
# refinement; 170 is the safe, conservative default for the reference machines. _FOOTPRINT and
# _HEIGHT are the same cap today — kept as two names for where the axis role is meaningful.
