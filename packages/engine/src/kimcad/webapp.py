"""Local web UI for KimCad (Phase 2, first slice).

A small, dependency-free web layer over the existing pipeline: a browser sends a
prompt, the same :class:`~kimcad.pipeline.Pipeline` runs, and the result — design
plan, printability verdict, target-vs-actual dimensions, and a 3D preview of the
rendered part — comes back as JSON the page renders.

Design notes:
- No web framework. The pipeline-to-payload mapping (:func:`design_response`) is a
  pure function, so the whole response shape is unit-tested offline with a fake
  provider and a stub renderer — no LLM, no binary, no socket. The HTTP layer is a
  thin stdlib ``http.server`` wrapper around it.
- The pipeline is injected, exactly as the CLI builds it, so the web layer reuses the
  tested wiring rather than duplicating it.
- Slicing to G-code requires explicit per-print confirmation. The design POST never
  slices; instead the user picks a printer + material and confirms, and a separate
  ``POST /api/slice/<id>`` slices the *already-validated, oriented* mesh — so confirming
  a print never re-runs the (slow) model. ``GET /api/gcode/<id>`` then downloads the
  proven G-code 3MF.
