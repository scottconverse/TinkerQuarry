"""Shared test fixtures (TEST-007).

``FakeProvider`` and the box renderer were duplicated verbatim in test_pipeline.py
and test_webapp.py. They are hoisted here as importable helpers plus fixtures so both
suites — and the new ones — share one definition. The helpers are plain
classes/functions (not just fixtures) because several existing tests construct a fresh
provider/renderer pair *inside* the test body (e.g. to assert call counts after a
retry), which a session/function fixture can't express cleanly.
