"""KC-2 (#8) — trusted template→STEP CadQuery emitters.

Every shipped template family gets a CadQuery twin emitter: OUR code, parameterized only by
the family's clamped float values — never LLM-authored — so the editable .STEP export carries
zero code-injection / RCE surface. The contract under test:

- every family in the default registry has an emitter (full STEP coverage, no silent gaps);
- emitted scripts satisfy the worker contract (assign ``result``, no imports) and pass the
  same sanitizer the worker enforces;
- values are coerced through ``float()`` (a non-numeric "value" raises — injection-proof);
- (live) each family's script renders through the REAL worker watertight at the family's
  analytic ``expected_bbox`` per axis, and the .step file is written and non-trivial.
