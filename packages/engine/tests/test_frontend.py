"""TEST-003: static frontend-contract checks for the web UI.

Stage 4 replaced the old single-file vanilla-JS page with a React + TypeScript SPA built
by Vite (build-time only) into ``src/kimcad/web`` and served by the Python server. The
committed build output is what ships — there is no Node toolchain at runtime — so these
checks read the built artifacts on disk and assert, by simple presence, that:

  1. the built ``index.html`` shell mounts the SPA (``id="root"``) and references its
     bundled module + stylesheet under ``/assets/``; and
  2. every asset the shell references actually exists in ``web/assets/`` (so a stale or
     missing build can't be served as a blank page).

The server-side half of the contract — that ``/`` serves this shell and ``/assets/<file>``
serves the bundles (with traversal rejected) — is covered in tests/test_webapp.py.

The frontend↔backend FIELD contract (the SPA consuming ``gate_status`` / ``clarification`` /
the printer-status vocabulary, etc.) is asserted against the TypeScript source as those
flows are wired in the later Stage 4 slices (design flow, then printer/slice/send); the
shell built in the first slice does not consume those fields yet, so there is nothing to
assert about them here.

Kept deliberately robust: presence checks on the build output, not DOM parsing or JS
execution, so cosmetic edits don't make it brittle, but a missing/stale build trips it.
