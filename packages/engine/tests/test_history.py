"""Stage 7 Slice 5 — the Smart Mesh learning store.

The store is local JSON and best-effort; `compare_phrase` is pure. These cover the comparison
wording (factual, never flattering), same-type narrowing, the record/load round-trip, and every
degrade path (missing / corrupt / non-list / malformed-record / unwritable) — none of which may
raise, because a logging miss must never break a build.
