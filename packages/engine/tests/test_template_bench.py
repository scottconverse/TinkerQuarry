"""Stage 5 — the deterministic-template benchmark/proof (kimcad.template_bench).

Two layers, mirroring the rest of the template suite:
- offline contract tests (no binary): the perturbation stays in range, the report formats and
  is console-safe, the no-model guard actually raises, and the ok/target logic is correct;
- a binary-gated live gate that renders + re-renders every family through the real pipeline and
  asserts the proof holds (watertight at the declared envelope, deterministic, no model call,
  under the non-flaky time ceiling). The <1 s interactive target is reported per family and
  documented in docs/benchmarks/, but the automated *gate* is the conservative ceiling so the
  suite can't flake on a loaded box. Skipped offline.
